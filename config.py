__**Giving Feedback**__

To put this post in two sentences:

Make sure your feedback is __consented__.
Be __positive__ with that feedback.

When giving feedback, above all else, you want to be respectful. It's easy to point out a bunch of flaws in someone's build, especially if you're an experienced player, but that's not your goal unless that's what that player is specifically requesting. Please be mindful of this...pretty much always. Only give feedback on role requests, classroom posts, module posts, ship posts, idea posts, etc, in the way that is being requested, if at all. At the time of writing, this has been a huge issue for a while. Adhering to this rule will help solve that.

It's easy to say "your X is wrong" or "your layout is unoptimal", but these are all negative phrases. Feedback is the most useful to the most people when phrased positively. "I like the way you did "X" is a good optimistic comment you will always find yourself able to make about something. Include at least a few positive takeaways in your feedback as well as your suggested improvements - it shows that you recognize that you're talking to a person and not just grading their homework.

Additionally, try to focus on the *how* and *why* instead of just the *what*. Telling someone their crew management is bad doesn't help them improve. Instead phrase things like "instead of doing X, you could do Y which would be better because Z".
